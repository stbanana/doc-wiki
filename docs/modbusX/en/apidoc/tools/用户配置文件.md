# **User Configuration File**

The customization and configuration of the protocol stack should be an easy task to control the resource usage of the software package.

In the `common/include` directory, there is a file named `MBx_user_sample.h`. Copy this file and rename it to `MBx_user.h`, and add it to a path that can be included.

In the global compilation `define`, add **MBX_INCLUDE_USER_DEFINE_FILE**. This way, the library will use the custom definitions from `MBx_user.h` instead of the defaults.

Since the configuration file complies with [CMSIS Configuration Wizard Annotations](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/Open-CMSIS-Pack-Spec/main/html/configWizard.html)，, you can use the `vscode` plugin or other methods to render the configuration in `MBx_user.h`, allowing for a more intuitive configuration. The recommended method is to use the `Arm CMSIS Solution` plugin for `vscode`.

Once installed, open the `MBx_user.h` file and click the "Open Preview" icon in the upper right corner to render the configuration file for graphical configuration.
